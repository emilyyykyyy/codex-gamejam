# Closing Cleanup

A short, Phaser point and click game about cleaning up a cafe. Wipe down some tables, return dirty dishes, or choose to do nothing <small>(as if they would fire you ... right?)</small>. 

Made for [Codedex's December 2025 Challenge: Game Jam](https://kol-07.itch.io/closing-cleanup)!
